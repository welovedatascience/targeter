Efficient Visual Targets Exploration 

Automated Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) for targets exploration, 
 for both binary and numeric targets. Describes a target by crossing it with 
 any other candidate explanatory variables. Generates aggregated statistics
 allowing to prioritize inspection, such as Information Value (including an
 extension of this metric for continuous targets). We also provide plot methods,
 automated reports based on markdown and a shiny gadget for interactive
 explorations. Package is aimed at investigating big datasets, both in terms of
 records and variables through the usage of data.table package.
