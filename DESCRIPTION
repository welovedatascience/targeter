Title: The Another Report Generation Engine for Target Exploration in R
Version: 0.5
Author: WeLoveDataScience
Maintainer: Eric Lecoutre <eric.lecoutre@welovedatascience.com>
Description: Automated Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) for targets exploration. Describes a target (binary/nominal/continuous) by crossing
    it with any other candidate explanatory variables. Generates aggregated statistics
    allowing to prioritize inspection, such as Information Value (including an extension of this metric for continuous targets).
    We also provide plot methods, automated reports based on markdown and a shiny gadget for interactive explorations.
    Package is aimed at exploring big datasets, both in terms of records or variables.
