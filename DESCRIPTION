Description: Automated Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) for targets exploration, 
    for both binary and numeric targets. Describes a target by crossing it with 
    any other candidate explanatory variables. Generates aggregated statistics
    allowing to prioritize inspection, such as Information Value (including an
    extension of this metric for continuous targets). We also provide plot
    methods, automated reports based on markdown and a shiny gadget for
    interactive explorations. Package is aimed at investigating big datasets,
    both in terms of records and variables through the usage of data.table
    package.
