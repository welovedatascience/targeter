## targeter

## targeter 1.0.0 

### Some informtion 

* This is a new release: first public version

* A reference somewhat specific to the package is mentionned in README file. 
  I might add some generic references about Information Value usage if required.
  The adaptation for numeric targets is though a creation of mine,
  work in progress to analyze it (hopefully a student's master thesis, so not
  for tomorrow...)
